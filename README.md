# West-Nile-Virus

This is work from an old Kaggle competition called "Predict West Nile Virus". (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus) 

The data collected is based on Mosquitos in Chicago between 2007 and 2014. There were traps set up and the mosquitos were collected and checked for West Nile Virus (WNV). For the odd years, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013, there is information about whether or not WNV virus was found. This data makes up the "Train" data. Conquently, the even years, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, make up the "Test" data. (Data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/data)

This challenge is to take the training data and predict WNV or not for the Test data.
